# EcoScan üå±

AI-powered waste classification application using computer vision to help users sort waste correctly for sustainable living.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Advanced YOLOv8 object detection for waste identification
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Camera capture, image upload, and voice input support
- **Real-Time Classification**: Instant waste categorization (recycle, compost, landfill)
- **Adaptive Performance**: Dynamic optimization based on device capabilities
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable with offline capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in testing framework and performance monitoring
- **Accessibility First**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecoscan.git
cd ecoscan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## üèóÔ∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern browser with WebGL support

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run check        # Run type checking
npm run lint         # Run linting
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
```

### Testing

Access the developer tools at `/dev` in development mode for:

- **Concurrent User Simulation**: Test with multiple simulated users
- **Automated Testing**: Run comprehensive test suites
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and optimization

## üß† AI Models

The application uses ONNX.js with YOLOv8 models:

- **YOLOv8n**: Fast, lightweight detection (default)
- **YOLOv8s**: Balanced speed and accuracy
- **YOLOv8m**: Higher accuracy for complex scenes

Models are loaded dynamically based on device capabilities and user settings.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: ONNX.js, YOLOv8, Custom waste classifier
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with DaisyUI
- **State Management**: Svelte stores with SSR safety
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline caching

### Key Components

- **Object Detection**: Real-time waste item detection
- **Classification Engine**: Waste category determination
- **Adaptive Engine**: Performance optimization
- **WebGL Manager**: GPU acceleration management
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment framework for model comparison

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Required Features

- WebGL for GPU acceleration
- getUserMedia for camera access
- Web Audio API for audio feedback (optional)
- Service Worker for PWA features

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Optional: Analytics and monitoring
