## **4. Core User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

### **Epic 1: Real-Time Object Detection**
```
As Alex, I want to point my phone camera at multiple items on my countertop
So that I can see bounding boxes around each object with disposal instructions
And make informed sorting decisions without handling each item individually.

Acceptance Criteria:
✓ Camera activates within 2 seconds of page load
✓ Objects detected with >85% confidence show bounding boxes
✓ Detection runs at >15 FPS on modern mobile devices
✓ Multiple objects detected simultaneously (up to 10)
✓ Boxes track object movement in real-time
```

### **Epic 2: Voice Classification**
```
As Maria, I want to say "plastic yogurt container" into my phone
So that I can get disposal instructions while my hands are full
And teach my children the correct category without stopping my workflow.

Acceptance Criteria:
✓ Voice recognition activates with single tap
✓ Speech-to-text conversion completes within 1 second
✓ Classification result displayed with confidence score
✓ Fallback text input if voice recognition fails
```

### **Epic 3: Image Upload & Analysis**
```
As Ben, I want to upload a photo of a confusing packaging item
So that I can get detailed disposal instructions and explanation
And understand why certain materials require specific handling.

Acceptance Criteria:
✓ Drag-and-drop image upload functionality
✓ Object detection runs on uploaded images
✓ Results show with detailed disposal reasoning
✓ Image processing completes within 3 seconds
```
